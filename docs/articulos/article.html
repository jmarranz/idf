<h1>Open source workflow and the BPM-market</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This article gives a compact overview of the open source projects, standards
and commercial tools on business process management and workflow.   The reason
for this publication is that a lot of companies are not even aware of the
fact that there are open source alternatives for business process management.
  This article intends to give those organisations a start in selecting the
open source workflow engine that best fits their needs.</p>

<h3 id="ossbenefits">Benefits for organisations using open source software (OSS)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Encourages software re-use</b>. 
    Open source software development 
    allows programmers to cooperate freely with other programmers across time and 
    distance with a minimum of legal frictions. As a result, open source software 
    development encourages software re-use. Rather than endlessly reinventing 
    wheels, a programmer can just copy someone else's elegant tire from another 
    machine. 
  </li>
  <li><b>Can increase code quality and security</b> 
    With closed source 
    software, it's often difficult to evaluate the quality and security of the code. 
    In addition, closed source software companies have an incentive to delay 
    announcing security flaws or bugs in their product. Often this means that their 
    customers don't learn of security flaws until weeks or months after the security 
    exploit was known internally.
  </li>
  <li><b>High-quality software</b>
    Open source software is potentially subject to scrutiny by many eyeballs. 
    Therefore bugs, security flaws, and poor design cannot hide for long, at least 
    when the software has a community of programmers to support it. And since fixing 
    the code doesn't depened on a single vendor, patches are often distributed much 
    more rapidly than patches to closed source software. 
  </li>
  <li><b>Avoids vendor lock-in</b> 
    Businesses no longer have to be 
    locked-in to the whims of a sole-source vendor. No more paying a vendor for a 
    needless upgrade, simply to maintain compatability with others using the same 
    software. Business data is also more "future-proof", since most open source 
    programs save text files in ANSI standard ASCII files, instead of proprietary 
    binary formats. If the vendors training materials are inadequate, because they 
    have access to the source code, external vendors can supply as good or better 
    manuals. Most successful open source software programs have extensive online 
    FAQ's, manuals, and mailing lists.  On top of all that, which commercial vendors 
    can guarantee they will still be in business next year ?
  </li>
  <li><b>Reduces total cost of ownership</b> 
    I'd like to start with the less known cost reductions : consultancy and knowledge
    base. Afterwards, the more obvious reduction in licenses is discussed. After purchasing 
    a closed source product, the vendors consultancy has a monopoly. Therefor this 
    consultancy is more expensive.  The vendors consultancy is also more superficial because 
    implementation details are not discussed.  The price for consultancy for open source 
    software has an upper limit because everybody can learn it from the sources.  
    The consultancy is more profound because consultants
    know about the implementation.  More knowledge is therefor transferrable to 
    employees of purchasing company, making them more independant.
    Most open source software is 
    available for a nominal cost, often the price of the media, or the time of the 
    download. No more "per-seat" license fees. Reduced acquisition cost means that 
    start-ups don't have to part with precious capital when they need it most. 
    Established companies can try the software with minimual risks. If the company 
    wants to develop a piece of software that they don't plan to use to 
    differentiate themselves, they can reduce the cost by collaborating with several 
    companies on the same code base. If you want to incorporate the code into your 
    product, you don't have to pay a license fee. 
  </li>
  <li><b>Independance</b> 
    If a bug-fix really matters to you, you're able to fix it yourself.  You're not tied
    to the prioritisation and release-schedule of the closed-source-vendors.
  </li>
  <li><b>Increases customizability</b> 
    Every business has unique needs 
    or desires--rather than live with a clumsy interface. Linux has been ported to 
    everything from embedded microcontrollers, to IBM mainframes. If there's a 
    nagging bug you want fixed, you can hire someone else to fix it. If two programs 
    don't play well together, one or both can be modified to eliminate the 
    incompatability. 
  </li>
  <li><b>Meritocratic community</b> 
    A true meritocracy, in the open 
    source community, a programmer's status and fame depends on programming skill, 
    not kissing some pointy haired boss's heiney. Open source expertise travels 
    well, and you can reuse software you developed for one company at future 
    employers. 
  </li>
  <li><b>Open source business model</b> 
    The open source business model : "open source software with commercially available 
    support" is gaining more and more recognition.  It gives the users of the open source
    software even better support then support for commercial products because there is more
    competition and they don't have a monopoly.
  </li>
</ul>

    jBpm's process definitions are based on UML activity diagram's.  That
establishes a clear and effective communication between process developers
    and managers.  jBpm includes a web-interface that will enable users to
execute in their browser without having to write code.  jBpm has a unique,
    powerfull mechanism for integrating existing IT-infrastructure such as
databases, ERP-systems, LDAP-systems... : it allows to add java-classes to
    your process definition.  The java-classes can access the process instance
information as well as the complete J2EE environment.  That feature     
creates a clear separation between the states of a process and the interactions
with other systems.  jBpm supports rich process modeling concepts      such
as parallel flows and process composition (=sub-processes).  The design of

    Open Business Engine, also known as OBE, is designed from the ground
up to conform to WfMC standards for workflow processors.  OBE is still in
    development but has already acquired the interest of numerous organizations
who are contributing to the project.  Once complete, OBE will      provide
support for XPDL for process definition with the ability to plug in parsers
for other definition languages, WAPI for client access,      using RMI initially
with XML-RPC and SOAP implementations to follow, a complete implementation
of the WfMC audit specification and support for      the Workflow Interoperability
specification.  OBE is J2EE compliant, executing on top of any J2EE application
server.  OBE will also include      an embedded version of the engine for
use directly in Java applications.     <b>"</b>

    <b>Quote: "</b>
    The werkflow system is a Petri net based engine for executing transactional
workflows. The design has been heavily influenced by the     academic literature
on workflow such as the papers of Wil van der Aalst and also by suggestions
from the diverse community of developers      that hang out on the Werken
company's IRC. Given the current immaturity and volatility of workflow standards,
the werkflow project has been      architected to be standards-neutral. The
core engine has a layered architecture on top of which new syntaxes and semantics
can easily be built.      This approach will alllow users to avoid vendor
lock-in and enable The Werken Company to rapidly roll out support for the
most popular standard      of the month. Currently, support for BPML and
BPEL4WS are being built upon the core engine to support current popular web-services
coordination      languages. While the current focus is on web-services specifications,
the werkflow system can support most any sort of process flow. The Werken
    Company is a small boutique consultancy, specializing in targeted, complex
problems. By focusing on the esoteric, difficult problems instead of    
 the every-day commodity problems, The Werken Company can provide improved
value to critical aspects of projects.     <b>"</b>

    <b>Quote: "</b>
    OSWorkflow is very different from most other workflow systems available,
both commercially and in the open source world. What makes      OSWorkflow
different is that it is extremely flexible. This flexibility can be hard
to grasp at first, however. In fact, OSWorkflow      does not contain graphical
user interface components. It is up to the application developer to provide
this sort of integration, as      well as any integration with existing code
and databases. These may seem like problems to someone who is looking for
a quick "plug-and-play"      workflow solution, but we've found that such
a solution never provides enough flexibility to properly fulfill requirements
in a full-blown      application. OSWorkflow gives you this flexbility.

    PowerFolder is an open source workflow studio and engine. It is easy
to install and use. The project team currently provides      free email and
phone support. PowerFolder takes your business process and brings it to life.
Applications are easy to create      with the web based developer studio.
The script studio draws the process similar to a flowchart and assigns actions
to each      state. The web page studio designs the web pages to interface
with the process.  XML is integral to the lifecycle of a process      and
its instances. The triggering data, process template, and process instance
are all formatted in XML. This makes PowerFolder      more flexible and eases
migration to future versions. PowerFolder is flexible. Processes can be created
with as little or as      much Java code as desired. A small amount of JSP
scripting can bring a process to life. Likewise, custom Java classes can
be      leveraged for more complex functionality. Administration and management
takes place through the PowerFolder console. Applications      can be deployed
and undeployed. Process instances can be queried and viewed. PowerFolder
follows the accepted conventions of      J2EE programming. No native or threading-specific
code is used. The persistence layer is agnostic and interchangeable.

      OpenFlow is a workflow engine developped by Icube and released as free
software. It is based on an object oriented structure, it        has a powerful
exception handling system and it supports dynamic redesign. These features
make OpenFlow much more flexible than        other existing workflow engines.
OpenFlow supports the open standards (XML/XML-RPC) and the web standards;
it facilitates integration        between heterogeneous systems thanks to
simple access to most of relational databases. OpenFlow is activity based,
multiplatform,        web-based, WfMC inspired, built and integrated with
the application server Zope, and it is completely free software.      <b>"</b>

    <b>Intro: "</b>ebXML BPSS (Business Process Specification Schema) is part of the 
      comprehensive ebXML B2B suite of specifications, which also includes core 
      specifications for reliable and secure messaging based on SOAP, collaboration 
      agreements and profiles, a registry/repository, and core components.
      BPSS is a relatively simple but effective schema that describes 
      public processes only. In a BPSS model different roles (seller, buyer, etc.) 
      collaborate to carry out a set of transactions. The orchestration of the 
      transactions is defined using a control flow based on UML activity graph 
      semantics. There is no explicit support for describing how data flows between 
      transactions. The transaction part of the model is based on a proven, robust 
      model for long-lived e-commerce business transactions used by previous B2B 
      standards such as RosettaNet. There is explicit support for specifying 
      quality-of-service semantics for transactions such as authentication, 
      acknowledgements, non-repudiation, and timeouts.

      from the BPMI.org (Business Process Management Initiative) organization. BPML 
      aims to provide a comprehensive means of specifying the processes of an

      the Public Interface of e-Business processes, BPMI.org provides a standard way 
      to describe their Private Implementation.'</code>
      BPML describes comprehensive control flow and data flow 
      constructs. It supports both short- and long-running transactions with 
      compensating activities. It also supports exception handling and timeouts. It 
      does not provide a means to specify characteristics that are important to B2B 
      processes, such as authentication and non-repudiation.

    <b>Organisation: </b><a href="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a><br>
    <b>Intro: "</b>WSFL (Web Services Flow Language) is IBM's proposal in this area. 
      It covers both public and private processes. WSFL is primarily focused on 
      describing Web Service compositions, and like XLANG uses WSDL to describe the 
      service interfaces.
      A <i>flow model</i> describes the workflow for a process. Both 
      control flow and data flow can be defined using a state-transition model. 
      Transactions and exception handling are not explicitly supported, but some of 
      the semantics can be implemented using conditional transitions. Activities in a 
      workflow can be exported as Web Service operations, and activities can also be 
      implemented by delegation to a Web Service. In this way WSFL supports Web 
      Service aggregation.
      A <i>global model</i> defines how the various Web Services are 
      linked together in the process. It is similar therefore to the business process 
      contracts of XLANG.
      Quality-of-service characteristics are delegated to a separate 
      specification called WSEL (Web Services Endpoint Language).

    <b>Intro: "</b>XLANG is Microsoft's proposal in this space, and like BPSS is 
      currently focused entirely on public processes.
      XLANG uses WSDL to describe the service interfaces of each 
      participant. The behavior is specified with a control flow that choreographs the 
      WSDL operations. There is no means for specifying data flow between operations. 
      Long-running transactions encompassing multiple operations are supported and can 
      be nested. Compensating operations for transactions can be specified. Exceptions 
      can be caught and recovery operations specified. Acknowledgements and timeouts 
      can be flexibly incorporated. Some support for agreements is provided in XLANG 
      by contracts, which defines how to stitch together Web Services of collaborating 
      partners.
      XLANG does not define quality-of-service characteristics of Web 
      Services such as non-repudiation and authentication, or guaranteed messaging 
      requirements.
